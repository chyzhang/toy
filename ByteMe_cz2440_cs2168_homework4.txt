Description:
    This is a toy project for team ByteMe pair Chi Zhang and Chengtian Xu.
    This project uses node.js, which help build a local server that does
    some simple tasks. Server side framework is express.js, database used is
    Mongodb. Together they perform a simple task of showing team member's
    info if you access the webroot which is localhost:3000/ . Also we used
    added React.js to be a part of the project, using which we implemented
    the random number function if you visit localhost:3000/random. 

Experience:
    We setted up the backend part fairly easily since we had some experience
    using express and mongodb. However it took us some time to figure out
    how to use the React module for View and Components parts of the MVC
    model. Also we are using eslint as a style checker and Jasmine.js as
    test tool, which can all be installed directly from npm.
